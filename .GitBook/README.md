This is the directory containing the files to make a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/about.html) book for the Intro R Workshop. You can find the
files online at https://github.com/robwschlegel/Intro_R_Workshop.

To render this GitBook first change the working directory to `setwd(".GitBook")` and then in the console run `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`. Using the knit button or drop down menu option from the RStudio GUI does not work as expected and actually changes the scripts. Not good.
