This is the directory containing the files to make a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/about.html) book for the Intro R Workshop. You can find the
files online at https://github.com/ajsmit/Intro_R_Workshop.

This book is rendered using the R command `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` while within this directory. Using the knit command from the RStudio GUI does not work as expected.
