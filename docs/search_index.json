It is important to swirl and sniff the wine, to unpack the complex bouquet and to appreciate the experience. Gulping the wine doesn’t work.” — Daniel B. Wright “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.” — Ronald Coase In the previous session we covered the five main transformation functions one would use in a typical tidy workflow. But to really unlock their power we need to learn how to use them with group_by(). This is how we may calculate statistics based on the different grouping variables within our data, such as sites or species or soil types, for example. Let’s begin by loading the tidyverse package and the SACTN data if we haven’t already. # Load libraries library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) # load the data from a .Rdata file load(&quot;data/SACTNmonthly_v4.0.RData&quot;) # Copy the data as a dataframe with a shorter name SACTN &lt;- SACTNmonthly_v4.0 %&gt;% # Convert the date column to &#39;Date&#39; format mutate(date = as.Date(as.character(date))) # Remove the original rm(SACTNmonthly_v4.0) 12.1 Group observations (rows) by variables (columns) with group_by() With the SACTN dataset loaded we will now look at the effect that group_by has on other tidyverse functions. First we shall create a new object called SACTN_depth. If we look at this object in the RStudio GUI it will not appear to be any different from SACTN. We may think of group_by() as working behind the scenes in order to better support the five main functions. We see that group_by() is working as intended when we create summaries from the SACTN_depth dataframe. Remember that one does not need to put the last bracket own it’s own line. I like to do so in order to reduce the chances that I will forget to type it after the final argument within the last function in the code chunk. # Group by depth SACTN_depth &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(depth) # Calculate mean temperature by depth SACTN_depth_mean &lt;- SACTN_depth %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), count = n() ) # Visualise the results SACTN_depth_mean R&gt; # A tibble: 13 x 3 R&gt; depth mean_temp count R&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; R&gt; 1 0 19.5 26299 R&gt; 2 2.00 13.0 237 R&gt; 3 3.00 17.6 141 R&gt; 4 4.00 16.6 529 R&gt; 5 5.00 15.0 408 R&gt; 6 7.00 17.2 227 R&gt; 7 8.00 17.8 201 R&gt; 8 9.00 13.8 311 R&gt; 9 10.0 19.5 362 R&gt; 10 12.0 24.3 137 R&gt; 11 14.0 22.3 223 R&gt; 12 18.0 24.4 191 R&gt; 13 28.0 14.8 306 Let’s visualise our newly created summary dataframe and see what we get. # Why does the relationship between depth and temperature look so odd? ggplot(data = SACTN_depth_mean, mapping = aes(x = depth, y = mean_temp)) + geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) Figure 12.1: Relationship bewteen depth and mean temperature. 12.1.1 Grouping by multiple variables As one may have guessed by now, grouping is not confined to a single column. One may use any number of columns to perform elaborate grouping measures. Let’s look at some ways of doing this with the SACTN data. # Create groupings based on temperatures and depth SACTN_temp_group &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(round(temp), depth) # Create groupings based on source and date SACTN_src_group &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(src, date) # Create groupings based on date and depth SACTN_date_group &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(date, depth) Now that we’ve created some grouped dataframes, let’s think of some ways to summarise these data. 12.1.2 Ungrouping Once we level up our tidyverse skills we will routinely be grouping variables while calculating statistics. This then poses the problem of losing track of which dataframes are grouped and which aren’t. Happily, to remove any grouping we just use ungroup(). No arguments required, just the empty function by itself. Too easy. SACTN_ungroup &lt;- SACTN_date_group %&gt;% ungroup() 12.2 Chain functions with the pipe (%&gt;%) This now brings us to the last major concept we need to become confident with for this workshop. Everything we have learned thus far builds on everything else in a modular way, with most concepts and steps therein being interchangeable. The pipe takes all of the things we have learned and takes them to the next level. And the best part about it is that it requires us to learn nothing new. We’ve been doing it all along, perhaps without even realising it. Let’s see what I mean. The following chunk does in one command what the first chunk in the previous section took two steps. This is not only faster, but saves us from having to create intermediate dataframes that only slow down our computer and clog up our environment. SACTN_depth_mean_2 &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% # Choose a base dataframe group_by(depth) %&gt;% # Group by thedepth column summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), # Calculate means count = n() # Count observations ) # Safety measure Take a moment and compare the SACTN_depth_mean_2 object that we’ve just created against the SACTN_depth_mean object we created at the beginning of this session. Same same. Not only does this keep our workflow tidier, it also makes it easier to read for ourselves, our colleagues, and most importantly, our future selves. When we look at the previous code chunk we can think of it as a paragraph in a research report, with each line a sentence. If I were to interpret this chunk of code in plain English I think it would sound something like this: In order to create the SACTN_depth_mean_2 dataframe I first started by taking the original SACTN data. I then grouped the data into different depth categories. After this I calculated the mean temperature for each depth category, as well as counting the number of observations within each depth group. Just like paragraphs in a human language may vary in length, so too may code chunks. There really is no limit. This is not to say that it is encouraged to attempt to reproduce a code chunk of comparable length to anything Marcel Proust would have written. It is helpful to break things up into pieces of a certain size. What that size is though is open to the discretion of the person writing the code. It is up to you to find out for yourself what works best for you. 12.3 Group all the functions! We’ve played around quite a bit with grouping and summarising, but that’s not all we can do. We can use group_by() very nicely with filter() and mutate() as well. Not so much with arrange() and select() as these are designed to work on the entire dataframe at once, without any subsetting. We can do some rather imaginative things when we combine all of these tools together. In fact, we should be able to accomplish almost any task we can think of. For example, what if we wanted to create a new object that was a subset of only the sites in the SACTN that had at least 30 years (360 months) of data? SACTN_30_years &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% filter(n() &gt; 360) Or what if we wanted to calculate anomaly data for each site? SACTN_anom &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% mutate(anom = temp - mean(temp, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% select(site:date, anom, depth, type) %&gt;% ungroup() Now, let’s select only two sites and calculate their mean and standard deviations. Note how whichever columns we give to group_by() will be carried over into the new dataframe created by summarise(). SACTN %&gt;% filter(site == &quot;Paternoster&quot; | site == &quot;Oudekraal&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) R&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 4 R&gt; # Groups: site [?] R&gt; site src mean_temp sd_temp R&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; R&gt; 1 Paternoster DEA 12.8 0.879 R&gt; 2 Paternoster SAWS 13.6 1.40 R&gt; 3 Oudekraal DAFF 12.3 1.36 12.4 Going deeper We learned in the previous session that one should avoid using comparison operators to compare logical arguments as this tends to not produce the results one would expect. Below we see what happens when we try to repeat the code chunk above, but using a logical operator within a comparison operator. SACTN %&gt;% filter(site == &quot;Paternoster&quot; | &quot;Oudekraal&quot;) %&gt;% # This line has been changed/shortened group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) R&gt; Error in filter_impl(.data, quo): Evaluation error: operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types. Oh no, we broke it! This is a common error while learning to write code so do try to keep this rule in mind as it can cause a lot of headaches. An easy way to spot this problem is if ones line of code has more logical operators than comparison operators you’re probably going to have a bad time. This is doubly unfortunate as we would need to write less code if this were not so. Happily, there is a shortcut for just this problem, %in%. Whenever we want to use operators to filter by more than two things, it is most convenient to create an object that contains the names or numbers that we want to filter by. We then replace our comparison and logical operators with that one simple symbol (%in%). # First create a character vector containing the desired sites selected_sites &lt;- c(&quot;Paternoster&quot;, &quot;Oudekraal&quot;, &quot;Muizenberg&quot;, &quot;Humewood&quot;) # Then calculate the statistics SACTN %&gt;% filter(site %in% selected_sites) %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) R&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 4 R&gt; # Groups: site [?] R&gt; site src mean_temp sd_temp R&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; R&gt; 1 Paternoster DEA 12.8 0.879 R&gt; 2 Paternoster SAWS 13.6 1.40 R&gt; 3 Oudekraal DAFF 12.3 1.36 R&gt; 4 Muizenberg SAWS 15.9 2.76 R&gt; 5 Humewood SAWS 18.0 2.03 The %in% operator can be a very useful shortcut, but sometime we cannot avoid the comparison and logical operator dance. For example, if one wanted to find temperatures at Port Nolloth that were over 10°C but under 15°C you could use either of the following two filters. Remember that whenever we see a , in the filter function it is the same as the &amp; logical operator. Of the two different techniques shown below, I would be more inclined to use the first one. The fewer symbols we use to write our code the better. Both for readability and error reduction. SACTN %&gt;% filter(site == &quot;Port Nolloth&quot;, temp &gt; 10, temp &lt; 15) SACTN %&gt;% filter(site == &quot;Port Nolloth&quot;, !(temp &lt;= 10 | temp &gt;= 15)) As one may imagine, performing intricate logical arguments like this may get out of hand rather quickly. It is advisable to save intermediate steps in a complex workflow to avoid too much heartache. Where exactly these ‘fire breaks’ should be made is up to the person writing the code. 12.5 Pipe into ggplot2 It is also possible to combine piped code chunks and ggplot2 chunks into one ‘combi-chunk’. I prefer not to do this as I like saving the new dataframe I have created as an object in my environment before visualising it so that if anything has gone wrong (as things tend to do) I can more easily find the problem. Regardless of what one may or may not prefer to do, the one thing that must be mentioned about piping into ggplot2 is that when we start with the ggplot() function we switch over from the pipe (%&gt;%) to the plus sign (+). There are currently efforts to address this inconvenience, but are not yet ready for public consumption. SACTN %&gt;% # Choose starting dataframe filter(site %in% c(&quot;Bordjies&quot;, &quot;Tsitsikamma&quot;, &quot;Humewood&quot;, &quot;Durban&quot;)) %&gt;% # Select sites select(-depth, -type) %&gt;% # Remove depth and type columns mutate(month = month(date), # Create month column index = paste(site, src, sep = &quot;/ &quot;)) %&gt;% # Create individual site column group_by(index, month) %&gt;% # Group by individual sites and months summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), # Calculate mean temperature sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # Calculate standard deviation ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean_temp)) + # Begin with ggplot, switch from &#39;%&gt;%&#39; to &#39;+&#39; geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_temp - sd_temp, ymax = mean_temp + sd_temp), fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.4) + # Create a ribbon geom_line(col = &quot;red&quot;, size = 0.3) + # Create lines within ribbon facet_wrap(~index) + # Facet by individual sites scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 4)) + # Control x axis ticks labs(x = &quot;Month&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;) + # Change labels theme_dark() # Set theme Figure 12.2: Line and ribbon plots for the climatologies of several sites. 12.6 Additional useful functions There is an avalanche of useful functions to be found within the tidyverse. In truth, we have only looked at functions from three packages: ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr. There are far, far too many functions even within these three packages to cover within a week. But that does not mean that the functions in other packages, such as purrr are not also massively useful for our work. More on that tomorrow. For now we will see how the inclusion of a handful of choice extra functions may help to make our workflow even tidier. 12.6.1 Rename variables (columns) with rename() We have seen that we select columns in a dataframe with select(), but if we want to rename columns we have to use, you guessed it, rename(). This functions works by first telling R the new name you would like, and then the existing name of the column to be changed. This is perhaps a bit back to front, but such is life on occasion. SACTN %&gt;% rename(source = src) R&gt; site source date temp depth type R&gt; 1 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-02-01 11.47029 5 UTR R&gt; 2 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-03-01 11.99409 5 UTR R&gt; 3 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-04-01 11.95556 5 UTR R&gt; 4 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-05-01 11.86183 5 UTR R&gt; 5 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-06-01 12.20722 5 UTR R&gt; 6 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-07-01 12.53810 5 UTR R&gt; 7 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-08-01 11.25202 5 UTR R&gt; 8 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-09-01 11.29208 5 UTR R&gt; 9 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-10-01 11.37661 5 UTR R&gt; 10 Port Nolloth DEA 1991-11-01 10.98208 5 UTR 12.6.2 Create a new dataframe for a newly created variable (column) with transmute() If for whatever reason one wanted to create a new variable (column), as one would do with mutate(), but one does not want to keep the dataframe from which the new column was created, the function to use is transmute(). SACTN %&gt;% transmute(kelvin = temp + 273.15) R&gt; [1] 284.6203 285.1441 285.1056 285.0118 285.3572 285.6881 284.4020 R&gt; [8] 284.4421 284.5266 284.1321 This makes a bit more sense when paired with group_by() as it will pull over the grouping variables into the new dataframe. Note that when it does this for us automatically it will provide a message in the console. SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% transmute(kelvin = temp + 273.15) R&gt; # A tibble: 10 x 3 R&gt; # Groups: site, src [1] R&gt; site src kelvin R&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; R&gt; 1 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 2 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 3 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 4 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 5 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 6 Port Nolloth DEA 286 R&gt; 7 Port Nolloth DEA 284 R&gt; 8 Port Nolloth DEA 284 R&gt; 9 Port Nolloth DEA 285 R&gt; 10 Port Nolloth DEA 284 12.6.3 Count observations (rows) with n() We have already seen this function sneak it’s way into a few of the code chunks in the previous session. We use n() to count any grouped variable automatically. It is not able to be given any arguments, so we must organise our dataframe in order to satisfy it’s needs. It is the diva function of the tidyverse; however, it is terribly useful as we usually want to know how many observations our summary stats are based. First we will run some stats and create a figure without documenting n. Then we will include n and see how that changes our conclusions. SACTN_n &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = round(mean(temp, na.rm = T))) %&gt;% arrange(mean_temp) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% select(mean_temp) %&gt;% unique() ggplot(data = SACTN_n, aes(x = 1:nrow(SACTN_n), y = mean_temp)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) Figure 12.3: Dot plot showing range of mean temperatures for the time series in the SACTN dataset. This looks like a pretty linear distribution of temperatures within the SACTN dataset. But now let’s change the size of the dots to show how frequently each of these mean temperatures is occurring. SACTN_n &lt;- SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = round(mean(temp, na.rm = T))) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% select(mean_temp) %&gt;% group_by(mean_temp) %&gt;% summarise(count = n()) ggplot(data = SACTN_n, aes(x = 1:nrow(SACTN_n), y = mean_temp)) + geom_point(aes(size = count)) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) Figure 12.4: Dot plot showing range of mean temperatures for the time series in the SACTN dataset with the size of each dote showing the number of occurences of each mean. We see now when we include the count (n) of the different mean temperatures that this distribution is not so even. There appear to be humps around 17°C and 22°C. Of course, we’ve created dot plots here just to illustrate this point. In reality if one were interested in a distribution like this one would use a histogram, or better yet, a density polygon. SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(mean_temp = round(mean(temp, na.rm = T)) ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = mean_temp)) + geom_density(fill = &quot;seagreen&quot;, alpha = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;) Figure 12.5: Frequency distribution of mean temperature for each time series in the SACTN dataset. 12.6.4 Select observations (rows) by number with slice() If one wants to select only specific rows of a dataframe, rather than using some variable like we do for filter(), we use slice(). The function expects us to provide it with a series of integers as seen in the following code chunk. Try playing around with these values and see what happens # Slice a seqeunce of rows SACTN %&gt;% slice(10010:10020) # Slice specific rows SACTN %&gt;% slice(c(1,8,19,24,3,400)) # Slice all rows except these SACTN %&gt;% slice(-(c(1,8,4))) # Slice all rows except a sequence SACTN %&gt;% slice(-(1:1000)) It is discouraged to use slice to remove or select specific rows of data as this does not discriminate against any possible future changes in ones data. Meaning that if at some point in the future new data are added to a dataset, re-running this code will likely no longer be selecting the correct rows. This is why filter() is a main function, and slice() is not. This auxiliary function can however still be quite useful when combined with arrange. # The top 5 variable sites as measured by SD SACTN %&gt;% group_by(site, src) %&gt;% summarise(sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% arrange(desc(sd_temp)) %&gt;% slice(1:5) R&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 R&gt; site src sd_temp R&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; R&gt; 1 Muizenberg SAWS 2.76 R&gt; 2 Stilbaai SAWS 2.72 R&gt; 3 Mossel Bay SAWS 2.65 R&gt; 4 De Hoop DAFF 2.51 R&gt; 5 Mossel Bay DEA 2.51 12.6.5 Summary functions There is a near endless sea of possibilities when one starts to become comfortable with writing R code. We have seen several summary functions used thus far. Mostly in straightforward ways. But that is one of the fun things about R, the only limits to what we may create are within our mind, not the program. Here is just one example of a creative way to answer a straightforward question: ‘What is the proportion of recordings above 15°C per source?’. Note how we may refer to columns we have created within the same chunk. There is no need to save the intermediate dataframes if we choose not to. SACTN %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% group_by(src) %&gt;% summarise(count = n(), count_15 = sum(temp &gt; 15)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_15 = count_15/count) %&gt;% arrange(prop_15) R&gt; # A tibble: 7 x 4 R&gt; src count count_15 prop_15 R&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; R&gt; 1 DAFF 641 246 0.384 R&gt; 2 SAWS 8636 4882 0.565 R&gt; 3 UWC 12 7 0.583 R&gt; 4 DEA 2087 1388 0.665 R&gt; 5 SAEON 596 573 0.961 R&gt; 6 EKZNW 369 369 1.00 R&gt; 7 KZNSB 15313 15313 1.00 12.7 The new age redux Remember the spreadsheet example from the first day of the R workshop? Here it is repeated in a more efficient way. Now with bonus ribbons! In this chunk we see how to load, transform, and visualise the data all in one go. One would not normally do this, but it sure is snappy! read_csv(&quot;data/SACTN_data.csv&quot;) %&gt;% # Load the SACTN Day 1 data mutate(month = month(date)) %&gt;% # Then create a month abbreviation column group_by(site, month) %&gt;% # Then group by sites and months summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), # Lastly calculate the mean sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # and the SD ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean_temp)) + # Begin ggplot geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_temp - sd_temp, ymax = mean_temp + sd_temp), fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.4) + # Create a ribbon geom_point(aes(colour = site)) + # Create dots geom_line(aes(colour = site, group = site)) + # Create lines labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;, colour = &quot;Site&quot;) # Change labels "]
